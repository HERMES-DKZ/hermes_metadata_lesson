::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



**Digitalization profoundly impacts the humanities by transforming how knowledge is produced, accessed, and interpreted. Almost everything today is reduced to data, interconnected through processes of digitization, visualization, and publication. Culture and history are increasingly manifested in networked forms, a development greatly enhanced by digital technologies. In this context, data and metadata play essential roles. This lesson is developed as an introduction to the meaning of data and metadata in the Humanities. Learners will get familiar with concepts of data and metadata as well as formats such as XML and JSON and metadata standards.**

This lesson is being developed specifically for researchers in the humanities and cultural studies, with the goal of becoming part of a future humanities curriculum within the Data Carpentry lesson program. It is designed for learners with no prior experience. It is visible at https://hermes-dkz.github.io/metadata_lesson/index.html.

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench.  
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench]() for full documentation.

There are a few sections in each episode of this lesson:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `challenges` are addressing problems and encourage critical thinking.
 4. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.
