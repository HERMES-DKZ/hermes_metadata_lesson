## Introduction

Take a moment to reflect: 

- Where do you get your information? 
- How do you write your texts? 
- How do you connect with institutions, both academically and professionally? 
- Do you rely on paper copies, or do you use digital photos? Have you ever visited an archive to conduct research in person? 
- Or have you explored a museum’s (or library’s) website to access digital resources? 

Think about how many aspects of your work and daily life are now digital—and how much of it feels second nature.

## Challenge: Reflection

Reflect on the last topic you worked on. Look for online resources that could support your research or deepen your understanding. 
What challenges do you encounter when researching or interpreting information published online?
:::::::::::::::::::::::: 

Digitalization profoundly impacts the humanities by transforming how knowledge is produced, accessed, and interpreted. Almost everything today is reduced to data, interconnected through processes of digitization, visualization, and publication. Culture and history are increasingly manifested in networked forms, a development greatly enhanced by digital technologies.

In this context, data and metadata play essential roles. Data refers to raw information such as texts, images, or records, while metadata provides context—descriptions, tags, or details about how and when the data was created.
The foundation of digitalization is the creation of data. Whether it's text, image, or sound, everything is converted into data that must be described and organized. This is where metadata—information about the data—becomes crucial.
When working with digital resources, both data and metadata are critical for organizing, searching, and interpreting information. Your challenges with researching online reflect the complexities of managing these elements—ensuring accuracy, maintaining context, and effectively handling large amounts of information.
To convince you that we, as humanities scholars, need to engage with data—before moving on to the more practical part, let’s briefly discuss the areas where digitisation is important for the humanities.
1. Transformation of Research Methods
Digital tools allow researchers to work with large amounts of data, such as scanned texts, images, or historical documents. Techniques like text mining, pattern recognition, and data visualization help uncover new insights that traditional methods can’t easily achieve. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with these methods—understanding the concepts of data and metadata is the first step into these topics!
The digitization of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums provides easy online access to a wealth of historical and cultural materials. This enables researchers to study sources from anywhere in the world, significantly broadening the scope of their work.
2. Changes in Dissemination of Knowledge and Impact on Teaching and Learning
Digital platforms have democratized access to research by enabling open-access publishing, allowing scholars to share their work with a global audience without traditional barriers of print publication.
Digital humanities projects often combine text, audio, video, and interactive elements, creating more dynamic and engaging forms of scholarship. This shifts how research is presented and consumed, moving beyond traditional academic articles or monographs. Digital platforms facilitate more interactive and collaborative forms of learning.
3. Preservation of Cultural Heritage
Digitalization helps preserve cultural heritage by creating digital copies of physical artefacts, texts, and sites, protecting them from physical decay.
4. Philosophical and Ethical Implications
The digital turn in the humanities raises important questions about the nature of knowledge, authorship, and authenticity in the digital age. Scholars critically examine how digital tools shape our understanding of culture, identity, and history.
Digital tools can democratize knowledge but also reinforce biases, depending on how they are designed and used.
5. Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Digital humanities are inherently interdisciplinary, bringing together traditional humanities scholars with computer scientists and data analysts. This collaboration leads to new research questions, methods, and forms of knowledge.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
